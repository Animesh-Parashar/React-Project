Pokedex WebApp

The web features the uses of PokeAPi - https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2 to Fetch information about various pokemon and display it.All the API calls have been structured with respect to the clearly written APi call section in the PokeAPI Docs
All the fetch calls have been made using the Axios Library - for its simplicity.

The project itself is divided into two main section - List View and Detail View
Some common component like Header and Pokemon Card have been built and used through the sections.

The project uses react React-Router-Dom With Params set to "Name" of the pokemon. Clicking teh the Pokemon card redirects the person to its detailed info 
with url- pokemon/{name}

For styling seperate Css file is included almost for evry component - In order to get the right Css styles regarding the pokemon theme online tools like Uiverse and Css playgorund were used.
